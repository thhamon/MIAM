Title (3481318): Interaction between quinolones and caffeine.

Abstract (3481318):
The effects of multiple doses of ofloxacin 200 mg, ciprofloxacin 250 mg or enoxacin 400 mg (all twice daily) on the pharmacokinetic properties of single doses of caffeine (220 to 230 mg) were investigated in 12 healthy volunteers. Intraindividual comparisons showed that ciprofloxacin and enoxacin significantly inhibited the elimination of caffeine. Ofloxacin, however, did not affect any of the measured pharmacokinetic properties of caffeine. Thus, caffeine should be avoided in patients with liver disorders, cardiac arrhythmias, latent epilepsy or in intensive care while undergoing treatment with enoxacin or ciprofloxacin.
