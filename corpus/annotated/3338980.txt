Title (3338980): Lithium tremor and caffeine intake: two cases of drinking less and shaking more.

Abstract (3338980):
Lithium tremor worsened in two patients when caffeine (coffee) was eliminated from their diets. An associated reduction in renal lithium clearance resulting in increased serum lithium level is thought to be the mechanism.
