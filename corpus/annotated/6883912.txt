Title (6883912): Acetaminophen metabolism in subjects fed charcoal-broiled beef.

Abstract (6883912):
The effects of consumption of charcoal-broiled beef on the metabolism of acetaminophen by conjugation were determined in nine normal subjects. We had reported that beef prepared in this manner accelerates the oxidative metabolism of drugs, including the oxidation of phenacetin to N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (acetaminophen). In nine normal subjects, a control diet was followed by a charcoal-broiled beef diet, which was followed by the control diet. The charcoal-broiled beef had little or no effect on the plasma-level profile of acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide and acetaminophen sulfate, or on the urinary excretion of acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide, acetaminophen sulfate, 3-methoxy-acetaminophen, or the cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates of acetaminophen. Results indicate that the enzyme systems that conjugate acetaminophen in man are subject to little or no influence by charcoal-broiled beef. Therefore dietary factors that increase drug oxidations cannot be assumed to have a similar effect on drug conjugation.
