Title (3838971): Augmentin bioavailability following cimetidine, aluminum hydroxide and milk.

Abstract (3838971):
Previous studies [Jackson et al. 1980] have shown that the bioavailability of Augmentin is not affected by food. The present work has shown that aluminum hydroxide, milk and cimetidine do have some influence on the bioavailability of a single dose of oral Augmentin, but the small differences observed are unlikely to be of therapeutic importance. It is concluded that Augmentin may be administered in clinical practice with any of these substances.
