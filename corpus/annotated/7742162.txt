Title (7742162): Effects of milk and food on the absorption of enoxacin.

Abstract (7742162):
The effects of milk and a standard breakfast on the oral absorption of enoxacin were evaluated in eight healthy volunteers in a randomized, balanced, four-way crossover study. After an overnight fast, 400 mg enoxacin was given with water, milk, a breakfast or with a breakfast and milk. The extent of enoxacin absorption was not affected by any of the three treatments, and no statistically significant changes were found with respect to peak plasma enoxacin concentration or time to peak. We conclude that enoxacin can be taken together with food and dairy products.
