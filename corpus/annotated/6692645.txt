Title (6692645): Effect of brussels sprouts and cabbage on drug conjugation.

Abstract (6692645):
Ten healthy subjects were fed three diets for 10 days each: a control diet, a cabbage and brussels sprouts--containing diet, and the control diet a second time. Oxazepam was taken on day 7 and acetaminophen on day 10 of each dietary regimen. The test diet stimulated the metabolism of acetaminophen, at least in part by enhanced glucuronidation, as evidenced by a 16% decrease in mean plasma AUC, a 17% increase in mean metabolic clearance rate, an increased ratio of acetaminophen glucuronide to acetaminophen in plasma from 1 to 11 hr after drug and an 8% increase in mean 24-hr urinary recovery of acetaminophen glucuronide, which returned toward control when the subjects were fed the control diet a second time. There were no comparable changes in the metabolism of acetaminophen to acetaminophen sulfate. When the subjects ate the test diet, 24-hr urinary recovery of the cysteine conjugate and of 3-methoxyacetaminophen sulfate, end-products of minor oxidative pathways, the former involving a toxic intermediate, decreased 13% and 22%. Cabbage and brussels sprouts induced a 17% decrease in mean plasma AUC and a 19% increase in mean metabolic clearance rate for oxazepam, but there was no change in mean plasma t1/2 for this drug, nor was there a change in ratio in plasma of oxazepam glucuronide to oxazepam.
