Title (6149298): In vitro interaction of neuroleptics and tricylic antidepressants with coffee, tea, and gallotannic acid.

Abstract (6149298):
The in vitro interaction of selected drugs with coffee, tea, gallic acid, and gallotannic acid was examined by mixing solutions of drug with each of these four preparations. Results of these experiments indicate that significant precipitation occurs for a variety of agents, including several phenothiazines, amitriptyline, haloperidol, imipramine, and loxapine. The strong complex which is formed between these drugs and tannins is probably the basis of the interaction of these drugs with coffee and tea. Although precipitates did occur with a number of neuroleptics, two members of this drug class, thiothixene and molindone, failed to interact with the solutions used.
