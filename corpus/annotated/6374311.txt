Title (6374311): Caffeine and theophylline counteract diazepam effects in man.

Abstract (6374311):
A total of 237 healthy subjects were studied in four placebo-controlled double-blind trials with parallel treatment groups. The subjects ingested a capsule (diazepam or placebo) and decaffeinated coffee with or without added caffeine or theophylline. Diazepam (10 and 20 mg) impaired dose dependently cognitive skills as measured by digit symbol substitution and letter cancellation, the balance of extraocular muscles, flicker fusion, and tapping speed. With diazepam 10 mg statistically significant effects were seen on digit symbols and exophoria only. Theophylline (10 mg/kg) increased tapping speed and heart rate, whereas other objective measurements were negative for the effects of theophylline or caffeine (250 and 500 mg) alone. Subjectively they reduced calmness, and caffeine also increased alertness. Caffeine 250 mg counteracted diazepam induced (10 mg) impairment of cognitive skills and relaxation of extraocular muscles whereas caffeine 500 mg counteracted the same effects of diazepam 20 mg, respectively. Theophylline antagonized diazepam-induced impairment in digit symbol substitution and tapping speed tests. Subjectively, caffeine and theophylline counteracted diazepam induced drowsiness and mental slowness. The results suggest, therefore, that the ample use of methylxanthines compensates various side-effects of benzodiazepines in man. It may also increase the need of sedation and thus the consumption of benzodiazepines.
