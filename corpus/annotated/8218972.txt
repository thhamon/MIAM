Influence of the diet on bioavailability of tetracycline.
It is well known that bioavailability of tetracycline (Tcy) is severely impaired when administered with milk and dairy  products, with antacids containing aluminium hydroxide gels and calcium or magnesium salts and with iron or copper salts. Tetracycline has a chemical structure with several sites where chelation with metallic ions can occur. Due to this fact, it is currently thought that chelation is the mechanism responsible for impaired absorption of this drug, and it is recommended to avoid its administration with these products. It is also well known that foods reduce the absorption of tetracycline, therefore reduction in the drug plasma levels is also expected. Because the high Ca content in almost any complete food is well established, and especially considering the particularly high content of this metal in the Mexican diet, the present study was performed in order to determine how diet would affect the bioavailability of tetracycline.
