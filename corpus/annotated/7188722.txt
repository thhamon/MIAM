Histamine poisoning in tuberculous patients after ingestion of tuna fish.
Two cases of histamine poisoning after ingestion of tuna fish occurred in tuberculous patients. The symptoms and circumstances leading to the reaction were identical to those previously reported for 2 other varieties of fish, skipjack and Sardinella (Amblygaster) sirm. Isoniazid, which is an invariable constituent of any antituberculous drug regimen, is a potent histamine inhibitor. When tuna fish, which has a high histamine content, is eaten, the histamine concentration in the tissues tends to increase, producing features of histamine intoxication.
