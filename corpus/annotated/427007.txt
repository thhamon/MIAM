Title (427007): Bioavailability of conventional and slow-release oxprenolol in fasted and nonfasted individuals.

Abstract (427007):
1 The influence of food and plasma levels of oxprenolol was examined in healthy female volunteers using both conventional and slow-release formulations. 2 There were no significant trends in plasma drug profiles due to food with either formulation. Elimination half-lives were longer after food with conventional tablets, presumably due to continued absorption. The opposite effect was seen with slow-release tablets. 3 Slow-release oxprenolol is, under the conditions of this study, a reliable and convenient dosage form, providing similar plasma-drug profiles in fasted and nonfasted individuals.
