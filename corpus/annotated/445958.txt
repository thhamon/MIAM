Title (445958): Lack of effect of bran on digoxin absorption.

Abstract (445958):
The effect of dietary fiber on digoxin absorption was investigated in 12 patients taking digoxin. Steady-state serum digoxin concentrations were determined while subjects were on a regular diet and while they were on a diet supplemented with 22 gm bran daily. During the period of bran supplementation, the serum digoxin concentration did not change (average change, +0.5%; 90% confidence interval, -12% to +14%). Bran does not cause a clinically significant reduction in digoxin absorption.
